# changemyview-factors-for-persuasiveness
Persuasion plays a pivotal role in human communication, and understanding the factors that contribute to the success of persuasive arguments is of great importance. In this project, we investigate the influence of emotion and sentiment on argument persuasiveness in online discussions. Leveraging the ChangeMyView Corpus from Reddit, we explore the interplay between emotional cues, sentiment, and the strength of persuasive appeals. We first classified emotion and sentiment features using fine-tuned transformer models. Then, we tried to use our learned features to predict the persuasiveness of each challenger's reply. We later trained 3 other classifiers for each model type, one using emotion alone as features, one using sentiment alone, and one using both emotion and sentiment. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that none of the models utilizing emotion or sentiment features outperform a baseline model based solely on the length of the reply. We conclude that reply length is a stronger predictor of persuasiveness than emotional cues, suggesting that longer replies are more likely to change the original poster's view.
